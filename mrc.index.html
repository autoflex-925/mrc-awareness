    <h1>Hold Martinez Refining Company (MRC) &amp; PBF Energy Accountable</h1>
    <p><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> February 1, 2025</p>
    <p>This website is dedicated to demanding accountability from Martinez Refining Company (MRC) and its parent company, PBF Energy, for their repeated failures in protecting our community. Recent events have left our neighbors in a state of uncertainty, with inadequate communication and safety measures during hazardous incidents.</p>
    
    <h2>Incident Report &amp; Case Overview</h2>
    <p>On February 1, 2025, a fire at MRC triggered a hazardous materials emergency that escalated to Level 3. Despite early knowledge of the incident, MRC failed to provide clear and timely warnings, leaving the community without critical information needed to safeguard public health. This negligence has resulted in prolonged uncertainty and potential exposure to toxic pollutants.</p>
    
    <h3>February 1, 2025 – Hazardous Materials Emergency Timeline</h3>
    <div class="timeline">
      <div>
        <strong>1:39 PM:</strong> MRC reports the fire to authorities, confirming early awareness of the hazardous incident.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>1:46 PM:</strong> Video evidence from the scene captures significant fire and heavy smoke, indicating the seriousness of the emergency.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>1:54 PM:</strong> The first public alert (Level 2) is issued via the Community Warning System (CWS)—a delay of 15 minutes that contributed to community uncertainty.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>2:39 PM:</strong> A second Level 2 alert is issued, despite escalating conditions.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>5:06 PM:</strong> A Level 3 alert is finally issued—this significant delay left the community without updated guidance during the critical period.
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Past Incidents – The 2021 Coke Dust Release</h3>
    <p>In addition to the recent hazardous incident, MRC has a history of inadequate responses to safety issues. In 2021, a Coke dust release incident contaminated the soil in nearby residential areas. Instead of addressing the contamination and protecting the community’s health, MRC’s response was to offer free car washes—a measure widely regarded as insufficient and dismissive of the real damage caused. This incident left many residents with lasting concerns about soil contamination and long-term health risks.</p>
    
    <h3>Our Case Against MRC &amp; PBF Energy</h3>
    <p>Based on these events, we assert that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Negligence:</strong> MRC repeatedly failed to provide timely, accurate, and actionable safety warnings, leaving the community at risk during hazardous incidents.</li>
      <li><strong>Public Nuisance:</strong> The delayed notifications and inadequate safety measures have created an environment of uncertainty and risk, interfering with the community’s right to a safe living environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Failure to Warn:</strong> Both the 2025 hazardous materials emergency and the 2021 Coke dust release illustrate a pattern of MRC neglecting its duty to inform the public about risks, resulting in exposure to contaminants and potential long-term harm.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>What We Demand</h3>
    <p>We call on regulatory authorities and community leaders to take immediate action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Launch a comprehensive investigation into MRC’s repeated safety and notification failures.</li>
      <li>Review and enforce stricter public notification protocols for hazardous incidents.</li>
      <li>Ensure thorough testing and remediation of contaminated soil and air quality in affected areas.</li>
      <li>Provide affected community members with access to health evaluations and necessary support.</li>
      <li>Pursue appropriate legal actions, including a potential class action lawsuit, to hold MRC and PBF Energy accountable for their negligence.</li>
    </ul>
